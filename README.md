# nationalparks-partner-docs

Documentation for Parks Australia's commercial partners.

These can be edited online directly from github (using the little pencil icon, if you are logged in with appropriate permissions), or the usual git way. The .rst files are in "reStructured Text" format (more info http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html).

## Wholesale / Integrators

TODO: this documentation will cover the Application Programming Interface (API). This will allow large organisations (or innovative smaller ones) to directly integrate their systems with the parks eTicketing system.
