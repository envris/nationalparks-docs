Roles and Responsabilities
==========================

Public users of the Parks Australia web site are essentially
anonymous. They do not have accounts, they do not log in to the
site.

Logged in users are typically members of 1 or more Commercial
Partner organisations, such as Commercial Tour Operators or
ticket retailers.

A user may have the following priveleges (roles) for an
organisation:
 * Guide priveleges
 * SalesAgent priveleges
 * Admin privileges

If a user has Admin priveleges for an organisation, they
automatically have SalesAgent and Guide Priveleges for
that organisation.

Admin priveleges allows a user to:
 * manage organisation configuration (TourTypes, Vehicles, etc)
 * invite/approve/remove organisation members
 * grant/revoke priveleges (SalesAgent, Guide, Admin)

If a user has SalesAgent priveleges, they are able to:
 * search for customer's tickets
 * edit customer's tickets
 * create FIT tickets on behalf of retail customers

If a user has Guide priveleges, they are able to:
 * search for customer's tickets
 * edit customer's tickets
 * Create PAX tickets and a tour manifest

A user can be a member of multiple organisations. They can have
different roles/priveleges in different organisations. This has
an impact on different navigation paths.

For example, see :ref:`logging-in`.
