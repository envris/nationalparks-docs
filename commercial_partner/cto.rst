Introduction
============

Parks Australia eTicketing system is a simple way for visitors to Kakadu National Park to purchase a ticket online, from retail shopfronts and through other partnerships such as Commercial Tour Operators.

It allows Independant Travelers to purchase tickets ahead of time, and modify tickets to suite their changing travel plans. It also allows Commercial Tour Operators to purchase tickets on a just-in-time basis to avoid the cost of keeping pre-purchased tickets in stock. It also allows retailers the same convenience, the ability to sell tickets without having to invest in stock.

This manual is for Commercial Tour Operators (CTO), who would like to purchase Kakadu National Parks eTickets without having to carry inventory.



Register your organisation as an eTicket Reseller
-------------------------------------------------

If you organisation is not already Registered as a CTO, then contact Parks Australia. This only needs to be done once per organisation. This will be integrated with the process for licensing Tour Operators, however could be some manual work as we process existing CTOs.

Parks Australia will create a record for your organisation in the system, and will set up one person as an administrator of that account. This administrator wil then be able to manage manage accounts for your organisation (including other administrator accounts). This can also be done over the counter at Parks Australia office or Visitor Center.

Register a user account
-----------------------

This only needs to be done once per person.

Each person who can access the system needs to have an account. Rather than creating yet-another user name and password for you to remember, you can use a social media account such as Facebook, Twitter, Google or GitHub to log into the eTicketing system. If you are unable to use one of these services from your workplace, contact Parks for an alternative (local) account.

When Parks Australia first sets up an CTO organisation, they create an administrative account for someone in the organisation. This person (Admin Account) will be able to create, delete and modify user accounts for that organisation, including granting and revoking administrative priveleges to other users.

Log into the CTO Portal
-----------------------

This needs to be done infrequently, such as at the beginning of the day or at the time a tickets need to be purchased.

Manage Tour, purchase tickets
-----------------------------

If your organisation's administrators have set you up as a Guide, then you will be able to purchase tickets using an internet connected device such as a smart-phone, tablet or computer.

This is similar to how Independant Travelers purchase tickets online, except that the CTO process has been streamlined as much as possible (so that Tour Guides that do not have to fill out individual details about each traveler). This means there are two kinds of tickets:
 * FIT Tickets, purchased by independant travelers online or through a Retailer
 * PAX tickets, purchased in bulk by a CTO using a streamlined process.

The main difference between a PAX ticket and a FIT ticket, is that the FIT ticket contains some details about the person who purchased it, whereas a PAX ticket is "anonymous" (only associated with the tour).

Another difference between FIT and PAX tickets is that a PAX ticket is only valid for the duration of the Tour. To become validid for the full duration, a PAX ticket must be converted into a FIT ticket by adding the missing details. This is optional, but may be useful for travelers that wish to remain on-park or come back to the park after the tour. There is no fee for converting a PAX ticket into a FIT ticket.

If a traveler already has a FIT ticket, there is no need for the CTO to purchase a PAX ticket for them. Instead the Guide can join the existing calid FIT ticket to the tour. If this means the Guide initially overpurchased tickets for the tour, a partial refund will be issued automaticly.
